### ðŸ”Œ Common Layer 1 Devices:
1. Hubs
	-  Simply repeat and broadcast incoming signals to all connected devices
	- No filtering or addressing-just raw signal distribution
	- Rarely used today
2. Repeaters
	- Boost or regenerate weak or distorted signals to extend the transmission distance
3. Cables and Connectors
	- Examples: Ethernet cables, fiber optical cables, coaxial cables, etc.
	- Technically not "devices" but essential Layer 1 components
4. Network Interface Cards (NICs) (partially)
	- The physical part (electrical interface) of the NIC operates at Layer 1
	- The logic inside the NIC works at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)
	- If the NIC were not transmitting any signal then you could assume it is a bad NIC
5. Media Converters
	- Convert signals from one physical medium to another (e.g., fiber to Ethernet)
6. Transceivers (SFPs/GBICs)
	- Send and receive signals over optical or electrical mediums
	- Common in switches and routers for modular connectivity
7. Modems (at the physical modulation side)
	- Modulate and demodulate analog signals into digital and vice versa
