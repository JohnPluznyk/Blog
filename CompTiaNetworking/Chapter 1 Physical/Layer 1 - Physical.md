The following will cover topics associated with Layer 1 of the OSI model.  Layer 1 of the OSI model is responsible for the physical connectivity of networking devices.  A device can be connected two primary ways whether that be a cable (RJ-45, fiber optic, coaxial ) or using radio frequency aka. Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11).  In order for a proper connection to be established both devices must be aware of each other and be using the same protocols in order to communicate.  If devices are using in correct protocols a poor or no connection will be made causing poor connectivity between devices.

## Connections
	How are connetions made between devices?
## Cables
	What kind of cables are there?
	Whats the difference between cables? speed?
## Ethernet
	Pinouts?
	Cat versions?
	Errors?
	Types of Ethernet?
	Acronyms?
	Distance?
	Fiber Optic?
	Connectors?
	Transeciver (tansmitter-receiver)?
	Duplex vs Half-Duplex?
## Wi-Fi
	IEEE standards?
