## How are connections made between devices?

In order for two or more devices to communicate over a network, they must use the same communication protocol and compatible physical media. One of the most commonly used protocols for local area networking is Ethernet, which can operate over a variety of transmission media including twisted pair cabling (RJ-45 connectors), fiber optic cables, and coaxial cables. Each of these media types supports Ethernet at different speeds and distances, and is chosen based on the specific requirements of the network environment.

Alternatively, devices may connect wirelessly using the Wi-Fi protocol, which is based on the IEEE 802.11 standards. Wi-Fi enables communication over radio waves and is typically used in environments where physical cabling is impractical or undesirable.

Whether wired or wireless, successful communication between devices requires adherence to the same protocol standards and the use of compatible transmission methods. This ensures that data is transmitted and received correctly across the network, regardless of the underlying medium.
